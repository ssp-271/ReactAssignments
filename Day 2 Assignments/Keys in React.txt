Keys in React are special string attributes that you need to include when creating lists of elements.
They help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
Keys can be used in the following way :
Using Keys with Lists: When you render a dynamic list (for example, a list of user objects), you should assign a key to each list item using a unique value from each item (like an ID).
Choosing a Key: The best way to pick a key is by using a unique string that identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often, you would use IDs from your data as keys. 
Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings: Keys used within a list should be unique among their siblings. However, they donâ€™t need to be globally unique.
