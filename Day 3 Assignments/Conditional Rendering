Conditional Rendering : 
It is used to render different components or elements based on certain conditions. It's similar to how conditional statements work
in regular JavaScript. In React, you typically use JavaScript operators like if,else, logical to create elements representing the curent state.
We can implement conditional rendering in the following way:

Using If..Else:
We can use it in the components function body

Using the Logical && Operator:
This is useful for rendering something based on a condition. If the condition is true, the element after the && will appear in the output
These are few ways in which we can achieve conditional rendering.
